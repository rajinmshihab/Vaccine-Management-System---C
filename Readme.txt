INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a deadly virus that has caused a global pandemic. Vaccines for the virus have already been developed and distributed throughout the world. The storing and distribution of vaccines in Malaysia is being handled by an authorized pharmaceutical company, namely, “Stars Pharmaceuticals”. This program will be an inventory management system of the company’s efforts to properly record and keep track of inventory and distribution of vaccines. The targeted system has been created using C language and the IDE used is Visual Studio Code.

ASSUMPTIONS	

After finishing the design and the creation of the system, I assume that this program will be able to do the following tasks:
•	Create an inventory record of all vaccines and their details
•	Add more vaccine records if required
•	Update the current inventory and create a valid record of distribution
•	Search for a vaccine record in the inventory via the vaccine code
•	Display all inventory records
•	Display all distribution records
•	Authorize user via a login section for security
•	Always trace all functions back to main menu for better accessibility
